And likewise, had there been contact that impeded 'E's passing through the gate, I'd have been more likely to hold the other balls responsible. The responsibility depended mostly on how affected 'E's trajecory was, given the initial contact between the billiard balls.  I feel as though I may not have factored in an important neutral element (how 'A' and 'B' might not have been responsible due to 'E's likelihood to travel the trajectory it had as well."
